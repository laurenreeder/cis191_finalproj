Lauren Reeder
CIS191 Final Project

My repo for project.git is wrapped with the server.html that I am serving. Also the ec2 instance that I am using is acutally Shirley's, since mine wasn't working and we couldn't figure out why. I used ubunutu instead of the git user.  The ec2 instance is ec2-54-244-81-213.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com and the files are hosted on server.html. My github is github.com/laurenreeder/cis191_finalproj.
